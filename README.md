### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**maduncan1/maduncan1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Makayla Duncan.
My email is maduncan1@my.waketech.edu.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my education and web development class. 
- ğŸŒ± My Github account is primarily for school and class use. 
- ğŸ‘¯ The repository I created is files copied from a Dreamweaver project we have been working on this semester. It is a simple portfolio website.
- ğŸ’¬ The steps I took to clone my repository to my local machine is I used the Github desktop app and then copied my files for my Dreamweaver website and then committed the files and pushed them to Github online.
